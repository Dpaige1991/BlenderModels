Twin City is a city on two floating islands that are close to each other. It has been connected with a wooden bridge wide enough to fit 3 people walking next to each other. 
The first Island has mostly farmhouses around built out of wood and seems more like the country-side
The second Island has a river coming from big cliffs, running down across the Island and down over the edge. The city is built half into the cliff carved out from stone. The other half is around the river, primarily out of
old construction elements retrieved from the gas-filled grounds below New Hope City. The second Island resembles a city with a big castle-like house at the city's main square. 
These two islands resemble a paradise with lots of green. Houses are built in a steampunk style out of mostly stone retrieved from the cliffs.
