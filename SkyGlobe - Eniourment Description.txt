The Sky Globe has been the success story of anti-gravity technology. When the gas was rising, people built a modern city on the highest point in the Old World. It was a successful refugee for people who escaped the gas successfully. 
After decades of improving its infrastructures, scientists started to warn local authorities that the gas is expected to rise because of unknown ruptures of more volcanos around the globe. A dangerous anti-gravity technology was developed and put to use after months of strikes polarizing its population in a fast effort. When finally the lever was turned to lift the three settlements up, citizens who were against the move were exiled to die on the left behind mountain tops.

Now the Sky Globe is an unachievable dream for many that live below, and only a few have been lucky enough to enter.

 The City is mostly built out of white Marmor-like materials and golden metals as finishings. Sky Globe city should be as big as New Hope city from the area, but 3 times as high.
The whole city is floating on an artificial metal ground that seems rounded. It should contain some canalization shafts leading out its sides on the outside.
 It is also connected with a shuttle to the Garden of Seasons and the Golden Tower. The whole City is covered in a Glass globe with an opening on the top resembling a jar.
