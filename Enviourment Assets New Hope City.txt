New Hope City is the starting location for a new player
It lays in a crater where used to be the Sky Globe*. The location is big and has walls around it with two entrances opposite of each other that connect to the Port. 
THe city'S style is resembling a settlement and build out of materials like wood, stone, rusty industrial parts but placed in a beautiful and clean manner etc. 
The ambience is friendly, peaceful and clean, lots of orange lights and latterns around the corners
(Mixed with candle light and more important locations should have makeshift electricity.) 
There could bew a few entrances that go below the city, since they use the lava from the volcano to generate electricity. It looks mechanical down there with lots of industrial walkways and machinery. 
It should be dark and have lots of natural stone visibile, few little rooms that could look like storage rooms for loot placement.

The location should have a few stores, namely a store for weapons, a store for equipment and devices and a vehicle(hoversails) store. Also a bar. All those should be at the main square of the city for easy access
Those shops should be located in the city. At both ports there is a raw material shop.
Both ports have a station for a rope shuttle**. 



*Sky Globe is a city that was lifted with a piece of the mountain out into the higher atmosphere through developing anti-gravity
** The rope shuttle is used to travel from the New Hope City to the Training outpost and the ShipYard that lay in mountain tips surrounding the mainmountain of New Hope City
