The ship yard is an industrial place housed in an old missle silo that is huge enough to house the manufacturing of the AntigravShips*
The missle silo is dmaged at the side that faces New Hope City, with a hughe hole that is blown into it shattering the wall of the mountain and the concrete of the silo
In there it would have a Steampunk style setting with lots of tunnels and rooms for military that are now used to manufacter the electronics needed for those ships. They also house some stores and accomidation for the working people there.
Conditions could be better and its relatively oily, rusty and dusty in this area. There should be a main community hall that goes 3 stories high and connects those different floors with catwalks connecting them. There should be ship merchant spot
and a customization shop spot for the hoverboard.

Into the mountain should be a mine that is being used to mine the minerals needed for construction, its also volcanic when you get into the lowest areas of the mine with some collapsed parts.

This should be a medium sized area

Mostly grey skyies because of the heavy industrial industry.
